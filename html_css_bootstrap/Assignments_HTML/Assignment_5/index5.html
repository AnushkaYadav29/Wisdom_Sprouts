    <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>

    <h2>Why I Like It</h2>
    <p>
        My favorite hobby is crafting macrame. I like macrame because it allows me to create
        beautiful handmade items using simple knots. It helps me relax, improves my creativity,
        and makes me feel happy when I complete a design.
    </p>

    <h2>How I Spend Time Doing It</h2>
    <p>
        I usually spend my free time doing macrame crafting in the evening or on weekends.
        I practice different knotting techniques and make items like wall hangings,
        keychains, and decorative pieces.

    <h4>Daily Routine</h4>
    <p>
        My daily routine starts early in the morning when I wake up and get ready for the day.
        I complete my basic activities and have breakfast before starting my studies.
        Throughout the day, I focus on my work and manage my time properly.
        In the evening, I relax and spend time doing macrame crafting, and listening to music.
        At night, I have dinner with my family and prepare for the next day before going to bed.
        This routine helps me stay organized, disciplined, and creative every day.
